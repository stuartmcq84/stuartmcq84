âš¡ **Fun fact**: The name "Python" was inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python. The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, was a big fan of the group and wanted to choose a name that was fun and memorable. When he was developing the language in the late 1980s, he decided to name it after Monty Python's Flying Circus, a popular sketch comedy show. In fact, the official Python documentation sometimes includes references to Monty Python, with modules named after characters and skits from the show. So next time you're coding in Python, remember that it's named after one of the funniest comedy groups of all time!
